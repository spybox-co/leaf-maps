Live Project: [leafmaps.spybox.co](https://leafmaps.spybox.co/)

## About project
**Project is at early development stage**.
App designed as mobile map in pocket and **PWA** (Progressive Web Application) to explore terrain by hiking, biking or any other outdoor activity.

Idea is to create an universal app that gives access to many types of maps designed to different purposes and activities, for example:

* Cycling maps with routes and bike trails
* Hiking maps with all terain marks
* Topographic maps for hiking and biking or just for exploring interesting data
* Transport maps for exploring Public Transport Network data
...and more 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
